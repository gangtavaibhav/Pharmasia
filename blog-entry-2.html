						<h3>World Diabetes Day – Help Your Family Member Defeat Diabetes!</h3>
						<p>
							India is the diabetes capital of the world with over 70 million cases being reported every year. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of awareness about diabetes in the country. World Diabetes Day is an event to make the public aware of the dangers of diabetes.

The International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) has decided that the theme of World Diabetes Day this year will be ‘Family and Diabetes’. The focus is on how one’s family can support and help someone who has been diagnosed with Diabetes manage it better. 

We all know that diabetes is a complicated disorder. It requires time, patience and discipline to defeat the disease. And in such difficult times, isn’t family the best support system? 
						</p>
						<p>
							People with diabetes may need insulin shots every day. Or they may have to take pills or capsules. Since diabetes treatment is long-term, your family member might forget to take the medicines now and then. But even one missed dose can be dangerous. How can you prevent that? Simple, you can set alarms for them to remind them that it’s time for their medication.
